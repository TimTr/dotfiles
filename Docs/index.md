# Dotfiles documentation for TimTr

This is the `index.md` file in the `./dotfiles/Docs/` directory.

NOTE: Update after renaming the root `index.md` file

NOTE: This is presently for testing purposes as the GitHub Pages documentation is being produced with the `index.md` file rendered from the root. Working to adjust that.
