# TimTr Dotfiles Documentation

This is the `index.md` file at root. **Updated April 22, 2025.**

This forms the root of the GitHub Pages documentation generated for this repository. It will link over to files within the `./Docs` folder of this repo for the actual documentation.

* Documentation (work in progress) [table of contents](Docs/index.html).
* Tasks and accomplishments in the [TODO.md file](Docs/todo.html) via relative path.
* Link the [commands file](Docs/commands.html) via relative path.
* Full link to the [overview file](Docs/overview.html).
* The [README](readme.md) file for these `Dotfiles`.

**Note:**  the `docs` folder must be in lower-case for GitHub Pages support, if you want to use it as the basis of docs. Capital `Docs` will fail. At present, this repository is setup to use the root of the repo for Pages docs generation, so this `index.md` file manually links to other documentation files. At this time the docs support is mostly place holder to ensure the Pages support works.
